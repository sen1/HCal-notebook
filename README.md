# HCAL iPython notebook

This notebook shows a simple data analysis in experimental particle physics. Data was collected with a prototype of a calorimeter for sPHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. At the end of the notebook you will learn how to reconstruct particle energy using a calorimeter.
